🌟 User Script Hub - Enhancing Your Browsing Experience 🌟
Description:
🚀 Welcome to the User Script Hub, a repository dedicated to collecting and sharing user scripts that enhance your browsing experience! 💻
👉 User scripts are small snippets of JavaScript code that you can install in your web browser using a user script manager like Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or Violentmonkey. These scripts can customize the way websites look, add new features, or even fix annoying issues.
🤝 Our community-driven repository aims to provide a vast collection of user scripts for a variety of websites and use cases. We welcome script contributions and feedback from users like you to keep improving and expanding our collection.
👀 Explore our repository to find scripts that can make your favorite websites more user-friendly, productive, or fun! 🎉
✅ To get started, make sure you have a user script manager installed in your browser:

    Greasemonkey (Firefox)
    Tampermonkey (Chrome)
    Violentmonkey (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge)

Once you've found a script you like, simply click on the raw file and then click the "Install" button in the user script manager's prompt. It's that easy! 💡
