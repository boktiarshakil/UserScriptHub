## UserScripHub Repository

This repository serves as a central location for your user scripts, potentially containing multiple scripts with various functionalities.

## Structure:

The recommended structure for your UserScripHub repository is to have individual folders for each user script. Each script folder should ideally contain:

    Script File (e.g., quran-reflections.js): This is the core JavaScript file containing the user script logic.
    README.md: This file provides information about the specific script, including its functionality, installation instructions, customization options, license, and any other relevant details (like authorship or contributing guidelines).

## Example Script (quran-reflections.js):

You can create a user script like the quran-reflections-popups.js script (mentioned earlier) that displays Quranic Reflections quotes. This script would reside in its own folder within the repository, along with its accompanying README.md file.

## Version Control:

Consider using a version control system like Git to manage your user scripts and track changes. This allows for easier collaboration, version history tracking, and potential deployment automation.

## UserScripHub Integration:

UserScripHub provides functionalities to manage and publish your user scripts. Refer to the UserScripHub documentation for details on creating and publishing scripts within the platform: https://openuserjs.org/about

## Additional Notes:

    Each script's README.md should provide specific information relevant to that particular script.
    Consider including screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the script's functionality in the README.md files (optional).
    Maintain a clear and organized repository structure for easy navigation and understanding.
